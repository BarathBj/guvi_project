# guvi_project - Youtube Data Harvesting Projects

# need packages & library
1.python -- used programming language
2.pymongo -- mongodb
3.psycopg2 -- for connection PSQL database
4.pandas  -- package for dataframe
5.googleapiclient -- for api key
6.streamlit -- need for web app

# api key creation - first we go to google console developer to create a new project and then select api services& credentials to click credentials and generate a Youtube API key and select a youtube api v3 and select need a function likes channel,comments,etc...

# Python - python is highlevel programming language for build website, application and base of (AI), machine learning and its easy to learn and use.

# Streamlit - streamlit library is used to create a user friendly UI that enable to interact with program and carry data and data analysis.

# MongoDB -  MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.

# PSQL - PostgreSQL is an Database Management System (DMBS), which means that it has relational capabilities and an object-oriented design. Using object-oriented features of PostgreSQL, programmers can: Communicate with the database servers using objects in their code. Define complex custom data types.

# Google API Client - Google API client libraries, which are available for many programming languages, can greatly simplify your YouTube API implementation. In the following tables, the first column shows each library's stage of development (note that some are in early stages), and links to documentation for the library.


# Youtube Data Harvest Project :  In this project Youtube Data Harvesting and Warehousing application, Retrieval of channel details and video details data from Youtube using Youtube API.

# Storage of MongoDB database used to stored some Youtube Channel details.

# Migrate of data from Mongodb to PSQL in storing same Youtube Channel deatils.
